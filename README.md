Demo can be found here:
http://159.65.232.230/ipns/QmRnw4LMRat6UAqsQwftuJkh3Wrbdc9hpQBaWYPfFu4oL8/

NOTE: Link will not always be live as this is a work in progress.

Application is not optimized and is currently still large and may need a refresh once or twice to get it to load. Will be removing unnecessary tools and implementing code splitting to fix load times. 


TODO:
* Finish paper on incentivizing behaver for voting scheme
* Optimize current smart contract
* Finish bounty submission contract
